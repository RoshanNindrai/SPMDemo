# SPMDemo
A small sample package created using SPM

# Usage
  Run swift build from root folder to create Utils module
  ```
  $swift build
  ```
  
# Swiftenv
   Since SPM requires swift 3, i would recommend using swiftenv (https://swiftenv.fuller.li/en/latest/) to manage swift versions.
   
# Todo

1. To make the sample package use SPM, to do so we have to remove the demo project from the root.
